## Goals

- Practicing how to organize code my using webpack
  
## Not to Do

- Spending unnecessary time on perfecting its beauty or structure, this is just a project to practice your knowledge, so you can move on as soon as it's *good enough*. That is, you're not supposed to work on your portfolio yet.

## To Do

- Style :)
